If you have an application that communicates with different API endpoints and you want to provide a setup menu to allow users to switch between those endpoints, you could implement the following steps:

1. Define your API endpoints and store them in a configuration file or database.For example, you could define an object with keys representing the names of your endpoints and values representing the URLs of those endpoints:

const endpoints = {
    development: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
    staging: 'https://staging.myapp.com/api',
    production: 'https://myapp.com/api'
};


2. Create a UI component that displays the available endpoints and allows users to select one of them.You could use a dropdown menu, a list of buttons, or any other UI element that makes sense for your application.Here's an example using a dropdown menu:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Picker } from 'react-native';

const EndpointSelector = ({ endpoints, currentEndpoint, onEndpointChange }) => {
    const [selectedEndpoint, setSelectedEndpoint] = useState(currentEndpoint);

    const handleEndpointChange = (endpoint) => {
        setSelectedEndpoint(endpoint);
        onEndpointChange(endpoint);
    };

    return (
        <View>
        <Text>Select an endpoint: </Text>
            < Picker selectedValue = { selectedEndpoint } onValueChange = { handleEndpointChange } >
            {
                Object.keys(endpoints).map((key) => (
                    <Picker.Item key= { key } label = { key } value = { key } />
        ))
            }
                < /Picker>
                < /View>
  );
};

3. When the user selects an endpoint, update your application's state or configuration to use the new endpoint. Depending on how your application is structured, you may need to pass the new endpoint as a prop to child components, re-initialize API clients, or perform other tasks to ensure that your application is communicating with the correct endpoint. Here's an example of updating the endpoint using React context:

import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

export const EndpointContext = createContext();

export const EndpointProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [currentEndpoint, setCurrentEndpoint] = useState('development');

    const handleEndpointChange = (endpoint) => {
        setCurrentEndpoint(endpoint);
    };

    return (
        <EndpointContext.Provider value= {{ currentEndpoint, handleEndpointChange }
}>
    { children }
    < /EndpointContext.Provider>
  );
};


4. Use the selected endpoint in your API requests.Depending on how your application is structured, you may need to update your API client to use the selected endpoint.Here's an example of using the selected endpoint with the fetch API:
import { useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { EndpointContext } from './EndpointContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { currentEndpoint } = useContext(EndpointContext);
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch(${ endpoints[currentEndpoint]} / my - api - endpoint)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => setData(data))
            .catch((error) => console.error(error));
    }, [currentEndpoint]);

    return (
        <div>
        <h1>My Component < /h1>
            <ul>
    {
        data.map((item) => (
            <li key= { item.id } > { item.name } < /li>
        ))
    }
    </ul>
        < /div>
);
};

In this example, we're using the useContext hook to access the currentEndpoint value from the EndpointContext. We're then using that value to construct the URL of our API endpoint using the endpoints object we defined earlier.Finally, we're making a fetch request to that URL to retrieve data and displaying it in our component.

Test your application with different endpoints.Make sure that your application is communicating with the correct endpoint when you switch between them using the setup menu.Consider testing your application with different API endpoints to ensure that it behaves as expected and handles errors gracefully.
By following these steps, you should be able to create a setup menu that allows users to switch between different API endpoints in your application.
